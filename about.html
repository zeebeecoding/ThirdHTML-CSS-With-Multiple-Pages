        <pre>
                 
            Sir,
             
            You know that Malotinagor is a very big village in your union. The inhabitants of the village have been suffering from an acute scarcity of drinking water for a long time.
            During the winter, most of the ponds dry up and the people have to drink polluted water of the ponds and the wells.
            Our women folk have to fetch water from a long distance and it is not always possible.
            As a result of drinking impure water, diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid and all kinds of water borne diseases break out and they take lives of many villagers every year. 
            So, we are badly in need of a tube well in our village for the supply of drinking water.
             
            We, therefore, earnestly request that you would be kind enough to sanction a tube well for our village and relieve our long standing suffering as early as possible.
             </pre>
